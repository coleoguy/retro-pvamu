# read in a FASTA file with the genome of the 
# organism you are studying you will do this with the R package
# APE which has a function designed to read FASTA files

# read in the GFF file that contains the annotation of the genome
# you should be able to use the function read.table to read the 
# GFF file

# Process the GFF file
## find genes with multiple exons
## extract out the coding version of the gene with no exons
## save the intronless version of each gene in a FASTA File

# Find retrogenes
## use blast to search for retrogenes
## if a retrogene matches your requirements then record
### parent gene name
### parent gene location (chromosome and location)
### daughter gene location
